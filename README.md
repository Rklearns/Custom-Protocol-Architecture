## Overview

Custom implementation of a reliable transport layer protocol demonstrating advanced networking concepts including sliding window flow control, SHA-256 data integrity validation, and multi-threaded concurrent processing. Achieves up to 7,372% performance improvement over stop-and-wait protocols.

## Key Features

- Custom reliable transport protocol built from scratch on UDP
- Sliding window flow control with configurable window sizes
- SHA-256 checksums for cryptographic data integrity
- Multi-threaded architecture with concurrent packet processing
- Perfect reliability (100% success rate in testing)
- Scalable performance (improves with larger files)

## Performance Results

| File Size | Stop-and-Wait | Sliding Window | Improvement |
|-----------|---------------|----------------|-------------|
| 3MB | 0.07 MB/s | 1.52 MB/s | +2,004% |
| 10MB | 0.07 MB/s | 3.85 MB/s | +5,083% |
| 20MB | 0.07 MB/s | 5.51 MB/s | +7,372% |

## Quick Start

### Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/reliable-udp-transfer.git
cd reliable-udp-transfer
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```
## üß™ Basic Usage

### ‚úÖ Option 1: Automated Testing (Recommended)

Run the complete test with both sender and receiver auto-launched:

```bash
python examples/fully_automated_test.py
```

### ‚úÖ Option 2: Manual File Transfer

For manual testing, open **two separate terminals**.

#### üñ•Ô∏è Terminal 1 (Receiver)

Start the receiver first:

```bash
python examples/test_receiver.py
```

You should see output like:
```python
[Receiver] Listening on port 5001...
[Receiver] Receiving file: received_output.txt
```

#### üñ•Ô∏è Terminal 2 (Sender)

In another terminal, start the sender:

```bash
python examples/test_sender.py
```

Expected output:
```python
[Sender] Sending file: sample_input.txt
[Sender] File transfer complete.
```

### üîç What This Does

- Receiver listens for incoming UDP packets.
- Sender sends a test file over UDP.
- Receiver writes received data to a file.
- You can verify file correctness manually or by checksum.

## Configuration

Edit `src/utils/config.py`:

```python
DEFAULT_HOST = 'localhost'
DEFAULT_PORT = 8888
WINDOW_SIZE = 5       # Sliding window size
TIMEOUT = 2.0         # Packet timeout (seconds)
PACKET_SIZE = 1024    # Total packet size
DATA_SIZE = 1004      # Payload size
```


## Important Limitations

**‚ö†Ô∏è Testing Environment**: This protocol was developed and tested exclusively on **localhost (127.0.0.1)** on a single macOS system with optimal conditions (0% packet loss, <1ms latency).

**Cross-System Deployment**: 
- NOT extensively tested between different computers
- Real network conditions will impact performance significantly
- Additional validation required for production use
- Firewall configuration needed for network deployment

## Platform Support

| Platform | Status | Notes |
|----------|--------|-------|
| macOS | ‚úÖ Fully Tested | Primary development platform |
| Linux | ‚ö†Ô∏è Expected | Standard Python/socket APIs |
| Windows | ‚ö†Ô∏è Limited | May need minor modifications |
