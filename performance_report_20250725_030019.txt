PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS
--------------------
Best Overall Performance: 5.51 MB/s
Optimal Configuration: 20MB file with window size 20

Sliding Window Effectiveness:
- 3MB file: 2004% improvement over stop-and-wait
- 10MB file: 5083% improvement over stop-and-wait
- 20MB file: 7372% improvement over stop-and-wait

CONCLUSION
----------
The comprehensive testing validates the successful implementation of a
custom reliable UDP protocol with sliding window flow control. The protocol
demonstrates significant performance improvements over stop-and-wait while
maintaining perfect data integrity across all test scenarios.

This implementation showcases the same core principles used in production
protocols like Google's QUIC and demonstrates advanced networking concepts
including concurrent packet processing and cryptographic data validation.
